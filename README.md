**Course:** Database Management Systems · **Year:** B.Tech 2nd year · **Team size:** 4
**Database:** PostgreSQL 15 or newer · **Final submission:** Mon 23 Nov 2026
**Topics used:** Data types & constraints · Keys & relationships · Normalization · Query execution plans · Indexing · Query optimization · VACUUM/ANALYZE · Partitioning & sharding

## Files in this folder

| Path | What it is |
|------|------------|
| `README.md` | This project brief |
| `seed_data.zip` | 10 CSV files (675,000 orders): the only input for Phase 2. Unzip it to get `seed_data/` |
| `queries/workload_30.sql` | The 30 queries for Phase 3 (do not edit) |
| `benchmarks/run_benchmark.sh` | Timing script: 3 runs per query, average, raw plans saved |
| `CHECKPOINTS.md` | Checkpoint dates and the files each one needs (DE and AP repos) |

**Getting started:** **clone this repository and push it into your team's DE repo** (the DE repo you submitted in the form); the steps are in [`CHECKPOINTS.md`](CHECKPOINTS.md). Keep the structure shown in [Repository structure](#repository-structure-submit-exactly-this). Unzip `seed_data.zip` inside your project folder, but don't commit the CSV files. Deadlines are in [`CHECKPOINTS.md`](CHECKPOINTS.md). Then begin with Phase 1.

## Phase 1: Problem statements

Blinkit promises groceries in **10 minutes**. That only works because every order is served from a nearby **dark store**—a small warehouse with its own **inventory** of products (stock on hand, reorder level and a store-specific selling price). A customer's order is packed, handed to a **rider** and delivered; if an item runs out while packing, it is delivered short or replaced by a **substitute**. Stores are restocked and lose stock to damage and expiry, all recorded as **inventory movements**. Small carts pay extra fees. You have joined the Blinkit data team.

The current database was put together quickly by an earlier team. It has **no documented schema** (only data exports survive), and the product teams are complaining:

| # | Problem reported | Team | Related queries |
|---|------------------|------|-----------------|
| P1 | "**Store assignment** and the **category/search pages** must answer instantly—every second counts in a 10-minute promise." | Customer app | R01, R02, R03, R04, R05 |
| P2 | "**Order tracking** and checkout (stock check, placing the order) slow down at peak hours." | Customer app | R06, W01 |
| P3 | "**Store screens**: open orders, rider dispatch and stock deduction after packing lag." | Dark-store operations | R07, R21, W02, W03 |
| P4 | "**Replenishment**: low-stock lists, restocks and dead stock are too slow to run every hour." | Supply chain | R09, R18, R24, W04 |
| P5 | "The category team's "**products not used as substitutes this month**" list is always **empty**." | Category team | R13 |
| P6 | "**SLA, fill-rate, wastage and rider** reports time out." | Operations | R08, R10, R11, R14, R15 |
| P7 | "Growth and finance (cohorts, small-cart fees, GMV, loyalty, recommendations, category sales) are slow, and orders will grow **20×**." | Growth / Finance | R12, R16, R17, R19, R20, R22, R23, R25, W05 |

**Your job:**
1. Rebuild a correct, well-constrained schema from the data exports (Phase 2).
2. Measure how the 30 most important queries perform today (Phase 3).
3. Make them fast **without changing their results** (Phase 4).
4. Prove the database will survive next year's growth (Phase 5).

**Deliverable for Phase 1** (`docs/01_problem_understanding.md`, at most 1 page):
- For each problem P1–P7, write in your own words what the business needs and which **stakeholder** is affected (customer, dark-store manager, picker/packer, rider, supply chain/replenishment, category team, finance, growth, support).
- Classify each problem as **customer-facing / real-time** or **reporting / analytics**. This decides your performance targets later.
- List any assumptions you make.

## Phase 2: Work out the schema from the seed data

You receive **`seed_data.zip`**. Unzip it to get a folder **`seed_data/`** with 10 CSV files, a real export of the production data:

| File | Rows | What it contains |
|------|-----:|------------------|
| `cities.csv` | 10 | Cities |
| `dark_stores.csv` | 120 | Dark stores (micro-warehouses) |
| `categories.csv` | 12 | Product categories |
| `products.csv` | 1,500 | Product catalogue |
| `store_inventory.csv` | 126,000 | Stock and price of each product in each dark store |
| `customers.csv` | 40,000 | Customers |
| `riders.csv` | 1,800 | Delivery riders (each attached to a store) |
| `orders.csv` | 150,000 | Every order from 1 Jan 2025 to 30 Jun 2026 |
| `order_items.csv` | 675,000 | Products in each order (ordered vs delivered quantity, substitutes) |
| `inventory_movements.csv` | 90,000 | Restocks, damages, expiries and adjustments |

The first line of every file is the header (column names). Here are the headers and the first rows of each file:

Open the files yourself (a spreadsheet, `head`, or `SELECT` after a quick load into a scratch table) and study the data carefully. **Nobody will give you the CREATE TABLE statements.** Working them out *is* the task.

### 2.1 What you must identify (for every table)
1. **Table name and column names.** Use exactly the file names and CSV headers. The 30 queries depend on them.
2. **Data type** of every column. Choose the *right* type, not just `TEXT` everywhere. Think about money, timestamps with a time-zone offset, yes/no columns, small whole numbers, decimals and short codes.
3. **Primary key.** Is it one column, or a combination? (Look closely at `store_inventory` and `order_items`. How should `inventory_movements` point to an inventory row?)
4. **Foreign keys.** Which column points to which table? What should happen **ON DELETE** (CASCADE, RESTRICT or SET NULL), and why?
5. **NOT NULL vs NULL.** Some columns are empty in some rows. Find out **when** and **why**, and decide which columns must never be empty. When are `rider_id`, `packed_at`, `picked_up_at`, `delivered_at`, `substitute_product_id`, `shelf_life_days` and `email` empty?
6. **UNIQUE** columns (natural candidate keys such as emails, phone numbers, codes and handles).
7. **CHECK constraints.** Write at least **12** that the data obeys and the business needs. Look for formats (store codes, SKUs), allowed values (statuses, movement types, payment methods), time order (placed → packed → picked up → delivered), quantity rules (delivered ≤ ordered, the sign of a movement depends on its type), and money rules (how `total_amount` is built; when the delivery, handling and small-cart fees apply).
8. **Relationships and cardinalities** (1:1, 1:N, M:N). Draw the **ER diagram** (image + Mermaid code).
9. **Normal form.** Show that each table is in 3NF/BCNF (list its functional dependencies). Point out any column that is *derived or redundant* (hint: `orders.subtotal` vs `order_items`; the fee columns vs `subtotal`; `store_inventory.quantity_on_hand` vs the movements and sales) and say whether keeping it is justified.

### 2.2 Rules for your schema
- Create every table in a schema named **`blinkit`**: `CREATE SCHEMA blinkit;` and `SET search_path TO blinkit;`
- In this phase create **only constraints**: PK, FK, UNIQUE, NOT NULL, CHECK. **Do not create any other index yet.** (PostgreSQL automatically indexes PRIMARY KEY and UNIQUE columns; that's allowed. Note which indexes exist.) Your baseline in Phase 3 must reflect a database *without* tuning.
- Your constraints must accept **all** rows of the seed data. If a load fails, either your constraint is wrong or you found a data problem. Explain which in your design doc.

### 2.3 Load the data
Write `sql/02_load_data.sql` using `\copy`, loading tables in the right order (parents before children):

```sql
SET search_path TO blinkit;
\copy cities FROM 'seed_data/cities.csv' WITH (FORMAT csv, HEADER true)
-- ... the other tables, in an order that satisfies your foreign keys
ANALYZE;
```

Then verify the row counts match the table above, and run at least **3 integrity checks** of your own (e.g. "every ordered product is stocked by the order's store", "a rider only delivers orders of their own store", "a substitute is a product the same store stocks"). Paste the results into `docs/02_schema_design.md`.

### Phase 2 deliverables
- `sql/01_schema.sql`: runs top-to-bottom on an empty database without errors
- `sql/02_load_data.sql`: loads all 10 files without errors
- `docs/02_schema_design.md`: data dictionary (table · column · type · constraint · *why*), ER diagram, FDs and normal form per table, integrity-check results, and every data problem you found

---

## Phase 3: Run the 30 queries and record the time

The file **`queries/workload_30.sql`** contains **30 queries**: 25 reads (`R01`–`R25`) and 5 writes (`W01`–`W05`). They're also listed in the [Appendix](#appendix-the-30-queries). **Do not modify them.** If a query fails, your schema doesn't match the seed data; fix the schema, not the query.

### 3.1 How to measure (everyone must use the same method)
- Run each query with `EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS)` and read the **`Execution Time`** at the bottom.
- Run each query **3 times** and record the **average** of the three `Execution Time` values. Keep all three runs in the raw plan file.
- Write queries (`W01`–`W05`) must be measured inside `BEGIN; … ROLLBACK;` so the data does not change.
- Close other heavy applications while measuring, and use the **same laptop** for Phase 3 and Phase 4.

The helper script does all of this for you:
```bash
./benchmarks/run_benchmark.sh <your_database> baseline
# → benchmarks/results/baseline/summary.csv   (avg, median, min, max, scan types)
# → benchmarks/results/baseline/R01.txt …     (full plans of all 3 runs)
```
> ⚠️ One of the 30 queries takes **noticeably longer** than the others on the seed data. That's intentional. Let it finish, and don't skip it.

### 3.2 Deliverable: the timing table
In `docs/03_baseline_timings.md`, fill this table for **all 30** queries:

| SQL Query | Type | Run 1 (ms) | Run 2 (ms) | Run 3 (ms) | Average (ms) |

| **Total (sum of all 30)** | | | | | |

Below the table, add for each query the **scan type** from the plan (Seq Scan, Index Scan, …) and one line on **why** it is slow or fast.

---

## Phase 4: Optimize the queries

Make the queries faster. **The results must stay the same** (same rows; order matters only where the query has an `ORDER BY`).

### 4.1 Techniques you may use
| Technique | Example |
|-----------|---------|
| B-tree index (single / composite) | the right column **order** matters: equality columns first, then range/sort |
| Partial index | index only the rows a query needs (e.g. a rare status) |
| Covering index | `INCLUDE (...)` so the table is never visited (Index Only Scan) |
| Expression index | index the exact expression used in `WHERE` |
| GIN index | for `ILIKE '%text%'` (extension `pg_trgm`), arrays or full-text search |
| BRIN index | for huge tables stored in time order |
| Query rewrite | sargable date ranges instead of functions on columns; `NOT EXISTS` instead of `NOT IN`; joins instead of correlated subqueries; keyset instead of `OFFSET` pagination; `UNION ALL` instead of `OR` across columns |
| VACUUM / ANALYZE | fresh statistics and visibility maps |
| Summary table / materialized view | for heavy reports that don't need live data (state how it's refreshed) |

**Not allowed:** changing the data, deleting rows, changing PostgreSQL server settings to hide the problem (e.g. huge `work_mem`, `enable_seqscan = off`), or caching results outside the database.

### 4.2 How to work
1. Put every index in `sql/05_indexes.sql`, each with a comment: **which queries it serves and why this type and column order**.
2. Put rewritten queries in `sql/06_optimized_queries.sql`. Copy `queries/workload_30.sql` and change **only** the queries you rewrite, keeping the `-- @R01` markers.
3. **Prove the results are unchanged** for every rewritten query (compare row counts, plus a checksum or an `EXCEPT` query). Put the proof in your report.
4. Benchmark again with the same method:
```bash
./benchmarks/run_benchmark.sh <your_database> optimized 5 sql/06_optimized_queries.sql
```
> 🔎 **Read the results, not just the timings.** At least one of the 30 original queries returns a **wrong answer** because of a subtle SQL rule about NULLs. Find it, explain it, and fix it. This is worth marks.

### 4.3 Deliverable: the optimization table
In `docs/04_optimization_report.md`:

| Query | Before (ms) | Problem found in the plan | Optimization applied | After (ms) | Improvement | Same result? |
|-------|------------:|---------------------------|----------------------|-----------:|------------:|:------------:|
| R02 | | e.g. Seq Scan on 126k store_inventory rows | e.g. use the `(store_id, product_id)` primary key + index on `products(category_id)` | | e.g. 95% (20×) | ✅ |
| … all 30 … | | | | | | |
| **Total** | | | | | | |

Improvement % = (before − after) / before × 100

Also include:
- **Before/after `EXPLAIN` plans** for your 5 biggest improvements
- **Write overhead:** which write queries got **slower** because of your indexes, by how much, and whether that's acceptable
- **Index storage:** the size of each index you created (`pg_relation_size`) compared with its table
- **Queries you could not speed up**, and why (an honest "this query must read most of the table" earns marks)

---

## Phase 5: Scalability report (large dataset round)

Your optimizations worked on 675,000 orders. Next year the business expects **20× the volume**.

By **Thu 19 Nov 2026**, faculty will release **`large_data.zip`**: the same 10 CSV files with about **20× the rows** (≈ 3,000,000 orders, ≈ 13,500,000 order items, ≈ 2,520,000 store inventory, ≈ 1,800,000 inventory movements, ≈ 800,000 customers). Until then, work on the design part of the report.

### 5.1 What to do with the large dataset
1. Create a new database. Run **your** `01_schema.sql`, load `large_data/` with your load script (change the folder name only), then run **your** `05_indexes.sql` and `ANALYZE`.
2. Run your **optimized** queries (`sql/06_optimized_queries.sql`). **Do not run the original 30 on the large data.** Some of them could run for a very long time.
   - R22 pages with `OFFSET`; if you replaced it with keyset pagination, explain how the "last seen" value is chosen for the large data.
3. Record the times and compare with your Phase 4 results on the seed data.

| Query | Optimized on seed (ms) | Optimized on large (ms) | Growth (large ÷ seed) | Meets target? | If not, what you changed |
|-------|------------------------:|------------------------:|----------------------:|:-------------:|--------------------------|
| R01 | | | | | |
| … all 30 … | | | | | |

### 5.2 Performance targets on the large dataset
| Query group | Queries | Target (average of 3 runs) |
|-------------|---------|----------------:|
| Real-time / customer and store screens | R01, R02, R03, R04, R05, R06, R07, R09, R21, R23, W01, W02, W03, W04 | **under 5 ms** |
| Interactive operations tools | R11, R12, R13, R15, R18, R22, R24 | **under 250 ms** |
| Reports and analytics | R08, R10, R14, R16, R17, R19, R20, R25 | **under 5,000 ms** |
| Batch jobs | W05 | **under 1,000 ms** |

If a query misses its target, **find out why from the plan and fix it.** A query that was fast on the seed data can become slow on large data for reasons that only appear at scale. Show the before/after plans for every fix.

### 5.3 Deliverable: `docs/05_scalability_report.md`
1. **Results table** (above), with every target met or explained.
2. **Growth analysis.** Group your queries by how their time grew when the data grew 20×:
   - *stayed about the same* (why? e.g. index lookups grow with log n)
   - *grew about 20×* (why? e.g. they read a fixed *share* of the table)
   - *grew more than 20×* (why, and what you did about it)
3. **What broke at scale** and how you fixed it (plans before/after).
4. **Storage:** total database size, table vs index size, on seed and large data.
5. **Architecture for 100×:** explain with numbers from your own measurements:
   - **Partitioning:** which table, by which column (RANGE / LIST / HASH), and why. Write the DDL for `order_items`, show partition pruning with `EXPLAIN`, and note the primary-key rule for partitioned tables.
   - **Sharding:** Would you shard by city, by dark store, or by customer? Nearly everything a store does is local—but cohorts and finance span all stores. Which queries become cross-shard, and how would you handle them?
   - **Read replicas and caching:** which of the 30 queries you would send to a replica or cache, and which must hit the primary.
   - **Maintenance:** VACUUM/autovacuum settings for `order_items`, archiving old data, refreshing summary tables.
6. **Conclusion:** is your database ready for next year? What are the remaining risks?

## Evaluation (100 marks)

| Phase | Criteria | Marks |
|-------|----------|------:|
| 1 | Problems understood, stakeholders and query groups correctly identified | 5 |
| 2 | Correct data types (6), keys and foreign keys with justified delete rules (6), ≥12 meaningful CHECK / NOT NULL / UNIQUE constraints (6), ER diagram + normal-form analysis (4), data loads cleanly + integrity checks (3) | 25 |
| 3 | All 30 queries measured with the required method (8), raw plans committed (3), scan type and reason for each query (4) | 15 |
| 4 | Speed-up achieved with appropriate techniques (12), every index justified (5), results proven unchanged (4), wrong-result query found and explained (4), write overhead and index storage reported (5) | 30 |
| 5 | Large-dataset results with all targets met or explained (8), growth analysis (6), scale-only problems found and fixed (5), partitioning DDL + sharding/replica design backed by your numbers (6) | 25 |

**Integrity rules**
- Every number in your reports must match the raw plan files in `benchmarks/results/`. Copied or invented timings make the whole phase score 0.
- Every member must have commits; the commit history is checked.
- You may use AI tools to learn, but you must be able to explain every index and rewrite in your individual analysis.
